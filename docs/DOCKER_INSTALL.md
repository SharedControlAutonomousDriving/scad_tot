# Docker Installation

The [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/grese/scad_tot) provides everything you need to run the project packed into a docker container.

## Prerequisites

* You'll need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed. So, install that first if you don't have it already.

## Installation

* Pull the image: **%** `docker pull grese/scad_tot`

## Usage

The easiest way to run the image for local development would be to use the helper script by running the docker_run_local.sh script.

* **%** `./scripts/docker_run_local.sh`
* **%** Visit `https://localhost:9999` in your browser (and accept the unsigned certificate)

## Other Examples

Check out the [Docker image's README](../docker/README.md) for more examples of how to run the image.
