--> Improving robustness based on counterexamples from Marabou <--

1. scripts 
i) retraining_upsample_counterexamples.py : Python script for upsampling of counterexamples and retraining of the model having the baseline architecture.
ii) crunch.py : Once the models are verified for robustness using Marabou, this python script gives the epsilon values over all output classes along with the overall minimum epsilon value.

2. models
Retrained models for original data + upsampled data (data of counterexamples from robustness and clustering verification tasks from Marabou was upsampled)

3. retraining_upsample_counterexamples.ipynb
Python notebook for upsampling of counterexamples and retraining of the model with different chunks of data.

4. All models were saved in .h5 or .pb format while training and then converted to .nnet format which is compatible with Marabou.

5. All retrained models were verified for robustness using scripts from verification -> robustness.ipynb.

6. Results and description are given in Results_update.pdf.
