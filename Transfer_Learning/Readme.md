##### Content:
This folder contains the code and the checkpoints for the transfer learning experiments.

##### Aim:
The idea is to obtain a deep learning model which is personalized for a specific driver.
This stems from the fact that there could be limited amount of data available for a new driver,
so we'd benefit a lot from leveraging the initial weights learnt by the baseline model and then
perform transfer learning for the new data.
